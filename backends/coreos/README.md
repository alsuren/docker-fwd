# CoreOS backend

Following the [coreos qemu docs](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-coreos/provisioning-qemu/).

This is the first backend that I tried. I gave up because of perceived poor performance, and switched to debian. See [my blog post](http://alsuren.github.io/2021/08/13/docker-yaks.html) for details.
